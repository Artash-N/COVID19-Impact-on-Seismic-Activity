# COVID19-Impact-on-Seismic-Activity
COVID19 closed doors of my school. But the windows to education remained open. I used this time of the lockdown to learn more about the environment around me and measure how things are changing around me. This included several variables, such as street noise, pollution levels, traffic count and seismic vibrations. 

Seismic vibrations or vibrations of the ground are caused by natural and human made activities. Natural activities include earthquakes, vibrations, ocean waves, and wind. Human made activities includes vibrations caused by transport, construction activities, railways, and even passage of big ships close to the shore.

To enable more people to measure changes around them I wrote this Tutorial. This tutorial would allow them to measure both natural and human made seismic vibrations. It would allow them to measure changes, if any, that occurred in their city during the lockdown or closure of most economic activities.

This project is on measuring the change in Seismic Vibrations during COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in cities.
